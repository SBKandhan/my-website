                           Unicommerce Service is a Windows service programme. This programme was created in.Net 6.0 and uses Sql Server. It will work with Unicommerce as well as another genuine system. 
                           Unicommerce will integrate with all online shopping platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Shopify, and so on. 
                           Unicommerce Service has several different work such as getting new orders, cancelling orders, creating invoices and manifests, and so on. 
                           These operations will run at regular intervals. I used a third-party library called hangfire to create this scheduler.

                           This is a smartphone application. This application was created in.Net 6.0 using the Avalonia framework.
                           It will compute the total wood cubic feet of furniture such as a bearo, cot, and so on. If we create furniture, we must calculate total cube feet utilising all wood sizes.
                           The furniture pricing is calculated by the vendor using the wood cube feet as well.It will be handy for carpenters and vendors to compute the price of furinture wood based on cube feet and save time.
